# Algo-Hamiltonian-Cycle

## Introduction
This repository contains implementations of algorithms for finding Hamiltonian Cycles in graphs. The algorithms are written in Python and are provided in the "Algorithms.ipynb" Jupyter Notebook file.

## Code Usage
To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/sh06565/Algo-Hamiltonian-Cycle.git

3. Navigate to the repository directory:
cd Algo-Hamiltonian-Cycle

3. Open the "Algorithms.ipynb" file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

4. Run the code cells in the notebook to load the algorithms and any necessary helper functions.

5. Once the code is loaded, you can use the provided algorithms to find Hamiltonian Cycles in graphs.

## Testing and Running
To test and run the algorithms, follow these steps within the Jupyter Notebook:

1. Load or generate a graph representation in the notebook.
2. Call the appropriate function from the notebook to find a Hamiltonian Cycle in the graph.
3. Optionally, visualize the graph and the Hamiltonian Cycle using graph plotting libraries like NetworkX or matplotlib.
